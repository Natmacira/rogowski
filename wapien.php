    <h1>‘Wapień’</h1>
    Wapień means limestone in Polish. All photographs, with the exception of (i), were taken throughout the months of March and April 2020 during in the first lockdown. The portraits are a result of collaboration with the subjects, friends with whom I shared the covid isolation bubble. I took these photographs during our discussions about what the future might look like. The project was an a prompt attempt to process the fast changing reality and the various contradictory emotions within myself and my collaborators. With the exception of (i) every photograph was shot in our shared bathroom.

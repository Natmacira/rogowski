<section class="about">
    <p>I'm a Silesian-Polish photographer based in Munich, Germany. 
    I grew up watching slide shows of my granddad’s photography and playing in mom’s darkroom. Years later, while studying and living in China I rediscovered photography as a path of reflection and observation. </p>
   <br>
   <p>In my work I explore how normative systems affect our societies and how the related tensions shape and transform us and our surroundings. My artistic work on these issues is complimented by my work as a scholar and practitioner in the legal field.</p>
